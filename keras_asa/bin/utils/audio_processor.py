# It's pretty done, now the src.shape == (348000, )
# However, Kapre, the audio preprocessing library expect something like (n_channel, length) 
#  because I wanted the `ndim` of the signal to be in a consistent format.
# So,...
src = src[np.newaxis, :] # now it's (1, 348000)

# That's it!
# But beware! You need another dimension, the batch dimension, in the model training. 
# So your final shape of the batch would be (batch_size, 1, 348000) which is not covered in this code.
